# Processing audio vinyl 12"

Loosely replicate the processing and play back of a vinyl record (WIP).

## New Features!

- When cutting rotate more than once per Processing frame
- Now draws the vinyl 'biscuit'
- Now renders an audio file placed in a data sub directory
- Add rendering of audio file to PDF vinyl

## TODO

- Create a label
  - Create side 1 and 2 (for realistic)
  - Add the file name as the text on the label
  - Add a matrix inscription as script text in runout
- Rotate the completed cut to replay back (or augment the source audio file)
