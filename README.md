# Processing audio vinyl 12"

Loosely replicate the processing and play back of a vinyl record.

## New Features!

- When cutting rotate more than once per processing frame

## TODO

- Create the biscuit splatter - rectangular (square) spiral
- Create a label
  - Create side 1 and 2 (for realistic)
  - Create the file name as the text on the label
  - Create the matrix inscription as script text in runout
- Create the hole
- Rotate the completed cut to replay back (or augment the source music file)
